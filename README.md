## About GameHaeDuo's Server
#### 1. Python Crawling Server  
  It crawls the data for each user in our program everytime a user logs in. And put that data into database.  
#### 2. Log-in Server  
  This is used to check if the user who logs in is valid or not. It is connected to the db with sockets. If user who logs-in matches with the database server returns true.  
#### 3. Sign-up Server  
  This server is only used when the user do sign up. User's nickname is verified with our OCR program. If the user's nickname is verified the user is allowed to sign-up. Sign up requires id, password, and their lol nickname. These information is saved in our database.  
#### 4. Duo-Matching Server

When there are enough people in our server matching queue, our match-finding algorithm is used to match two people together. Once matched, the server sends a message to each user about their duo information and asks if they want accept.
